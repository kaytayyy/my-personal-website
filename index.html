        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Katie. You are currently looking at my final project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp prep course AND my first website! I am very excited to welcome you!</p>
        <p>I'm finishing up my prep work for the Software Engineering bootcamp with Flatiron school. The real course starts in a little over a week
            and I am so incredibly excited about it. It's been a lot of work getting here but I feel like it's been worth it. So, how did I get here?
            Well, my mental health hasn't always been my friend. I graduated from high school and had to take some time off to really pull myself together,
            I started at my local community college in the second semester of the year, ironically in psychology, and then covid hit. I went through all of this work,
            not just with school and actual work, but also my mental health and I just felt stuck. I realized that psychology wasn't for me, and then some time later 
            realized that regular school wasn't for me either. So I tried learning to code by myself, with some help from Harvard's CS50 course and The Odin Project.
            No hate to either of them, I just needed help to get further along and that's when I applied to Flatiron School. You're pretty caught up on the 
            last few years now, let me tell you about the cool stuff instead.

        <h4>The cool stuff</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I have 2 dogs and a cat, pictured below</li>
            <li>I used to have purple hair, then pink, and now I'm back to brown, I miss having colored hair</li>
            <li>I've learned a lot with Flatiron School and hope to learn so much more</li>
            <li>I learned to crochet by myself, which, in a sense is like coding</li>
        </ul>
